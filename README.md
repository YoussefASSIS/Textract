# Textract and OCR python libraries
## Textract
A python library that extract useful information text from any source of data including word documents, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, etcâ€”so-called. 
## OCR
A python library that recognize characters from images.

Using Textract python library, we transform each pdf page into hight quality image that is stored in the local storage and then with OCR python library, we extract text from those images.

From my experience with this library, I have noted the following ideas:
- Advantages:
  - Enhance PDF's scanned image quality and get better results.
  - It is simple and easy-to-use.
  - Quality Results.
  - Lets you set dpi for your PDF to customize the quality of your results.
- Disadvantages:
  - Takes approx. 2 seconds for each page on PDF.
  - Uses too much storage space.
